# [SDF05] CSS Magic Buttons

The changes i made to the following buttons were simple yet fun to interact with.

The first change i made was add my buttons: "button1, button2, button3
I added a shorthand transition for btn1,btn2,btn3: "transition: all 0,5s ease-in-out"
A background-image was added to get a color gradient: the "radial-gradient" i chose varient colors for each button 
with padding,borders and border radius to eact button.
With each button i added a hover button for animations and to be more attractive
Box shadow was added
transform scale was added 
Animation was added 
finally Keyframe animation was added to create a pulsating button. 

I struggle with placement of putting information but got it right in the end i am particurly 
proud of the animation i added and a bit of shadow i used for emphasis.
